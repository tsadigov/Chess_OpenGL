The code is written in C++

In my experience, I used CodeBlocks to create the project. 
To run the code you should first install 17.12 version of CodeBlocks with MinGW package. 
Then follow the instructions given in the attached link below to setup GLUT in Codeblocks:

After the setup, copy and paste the main.cpp file content to newly created main.cpp file. Save and run. 

Note: Each chess figure is drawn by a function, and there is no movement conditions in code. Any chess figure can move anywhere, just play right :)))
